# SIEM GraphQL-based Project (TypeScript)

Welcome to the SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) GraphQL-based project! This project is designed to provide a powerful and flexible security monitoring solution by leveraging the capabilities of GraphQL and TypeScript. The SIEM system collects, analyzes, and correlates security events from various sources, helping you gain insights into potential security threats and vulnerabilities.

## Features

- GraphQL API for querying and managing security events.
- Real-time event monitoring and alerting.
- Integration with various data sources and security tools.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for enhanced security.
- Customizable dashboards and visualizations.
- Rule-based event correlation for identifying complex attack patterns.
- Extensible architecture to support future enhancements.

## Technologies

The SIEM project is built using the following technologies:

- **GraphQL**: Provides a powerful and efficient API for querying and managing data.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and scalability for the project.
- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
- **Express**: Web application framework for Node.js.
- **TypeORM**: TypeScript-based ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library for database interaction.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing security event data.
- **WebSocket**: Enables real-time event monitoring and alerting.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for user authentication and authorization.
- **Docker**: Containerization for easy deployment and scalability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the SIEM project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/BaseMax/SIEMGraphQLTS.git`
- Navigate to the project directory: `cd SIEMGraphQLTS`
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Set up the database: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and create a new database for the project. Update the database configuration in `ormconfig.json`.
- Build the project: `npm run build`
- Run database migrations: `npm run migrations`
- Start the server: `npm start`
- The SIEM GraphQL server should now be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the SIEM system using GraphQL queries and mutations. Refer to the API documentation or explore the GraphQL playground (usually available at http://localhost:3000/graphql) to understand the available queries and mutations.

Here's a simple example of a GraphQL query:

```graphql
query {
  events {
    id
    timestamp
    sourceIP
    destinationIP
    eventType
    severity
  }
}
```

Remember to authenticate and authorize your GraphQL requests using JWT tokens when required.
